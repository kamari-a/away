# Away
Away is a responsive web application that allows users to search, book, and upload luxury rental properties. 

It was built using React.js and Firebase Authentication for the front end, and Node.js and Express.js for the back end.

# Instructions

# Next Steps
My next steps for this project are:
- to add functionality that will allow the user to save their favourite listings 
- to embed Google's Maps API into the single listing components which will display the property's location to the user
